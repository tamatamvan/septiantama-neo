Hello, (again) world!

Hi, it's me Tama. This is an intro article.

Actually, I'm not sure how you ended up being in this blog. Maybe it's from the link I've shared before. But whoever you are and wherever you're coming from, I would like to say thanks for coming here and spend your time reading this blog (You'll stay till the end right?).

This blog actually isn't my first blog, it's my fourth one. Sadly, all my previous three blogs are already inactive. Two of them had already taken down (by myself) from the internet, while the other one actually still alive but I won't update anything on it anymore. 

## When it all started

I first started my blogging activity back when I was still in 3rd year of middle school, which is already about 6 years ago. My first blog was a bit random. I wrote some random stuff like personal opinions/thoughts, tech stuff, short stories, poems, and sometimes simply posted translation of English articles I found interesting. Then after being active for a while, I went to hiatus after I entered vocational school. When I feel like I want to begin writing again, I decided to start a new blog instead of continuing the previous one. This time I'm being more focused on tech stuff as the contents for the blog. This tech blog was active until I graduated. And since I started my "adult" life with a full-time job, I never really start writing or blogging again.

After living this kind of "adult" life for about more than three years, I think I have a lot of things I've learned. It will be such a waste for me not to share them. Also, my inner-self already struggles to let out what's in this brain and what's in this heart. Thereby, I believe now is the right moment for me to start over again.

## So, what about this blog?

I've told you briefly about my previous blogging activities in the past. Now maybe you're wondering what kind of blog this gonna be. To be honest with you, it's still too early to be sure about what direction this blog gonna take. However, if you ask me about the vision I have at the moment, this gonna be more similar to my first blog. This one will be a quite casual blog that I wanna keep as simple as possible.

Previously, I also chatted with several people, sharing the idea of me starting a new blog again. Some of them who know me as a Web Developer expect the blog to be a technical one. Well, maybe I'm gonna write some technical articles in the future, though right now it's not my main focus on this blog.

Some of them also asked me, why not using any platform like Medium? Well, Medium is great. With its huge pool of community and audiences, Medium can be a great option.  It may be a good place to get more coverage in a shorter period. But the thing is, Medium is a platform that is run by people as a business. I don't have any control over it, and that makes me feel uneasy in case something happened to it. Also, the fact that nowadays most articles there are staying behind their paywall kinda pissed me off. I really miss the days when I read a bunch of articles there without paywall popping up and ask me to pay some bucks.

So, this blog will be more like my personal space. A place for my own self retrospective where I can emphasize myself, where I can share anything I want, and speak the things I really care about to the world. I hope that I will be able to produce content for this blog consistently, and this blog will stay alive for a really long period.

Ah, I almost forgot about the language. Yeah, I will write in English.  I consider that writing in English would enable me to reach broader audiences, and I really want to improve my written English.  In the future, I may also write in Bahasa. Still, my main focus is to write in English.

Well, I think this is enough for an intro article. I am very grateful that you're reading this till the very end. Also, it will be good if anyone who reads something from this blog can learn one or two things, I'm not really expecting anything tho.

I wish you a good life, thanks and see ya!
