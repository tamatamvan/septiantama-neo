Kid,<br/>
I need you to come back<br/>
There are so many walls we need to break<br/>
And You're the only one who can do it<br/>
I'm still here and I'm so afraid<br/>

It's fine if you gonna leave me<br/>
But please be with me even just for awhile<br/>
Be with me and break me free<br/>
From this stinky and narrow cage<br/>

The knowledge has become a curse<br/>
When I move it hurts me<br/>
Society has become a prison<br/>
People's stares are freezing me<br/>
They keep telling me what's right and what's wrong<br/>
But what do they know about me?<br/>

All they do is making me afraid<br/>
God, please save me
