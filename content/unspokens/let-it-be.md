Something in life will be broken<br/>
And no matter how hard you try<br/>
You may not be able to fix it<br/>
Eventually,<br/>
All you can do is to leave it as it is<br/>

Let it be<br/>
It may hurts you<br/>
But it won't kill you<br/>

You may hate it<br/>
You may not want it<br/>
Of course you don't want it<br/>
But sometimes it's just necessary <br/>
As a part of your journey <br/>

For you to be stronger<br/>
Unbeatable in your future<br/>
Then bloom and shine<br/>
The way you wanna be<br/>
