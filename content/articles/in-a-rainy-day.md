That can't find the sun who's hiding behind the cloud."

It's fading away<br/>
Blown away like the dust<br/>
Nothing's here to stay<br/>
And time keeps moving so fast<br/>
Leaving me with nothing to trust<br/>
Everything left I wish to crush<br/>

Love is something I can't comprehend<br/>
When it's coming to me I tried to understand<br/>
And when I'm still learning it left me behind<br/>
It's not a scar that's being left, just an empty space<br/>
No tears, no smile, cause to whom I suppose to give them?<br/>

Even things I thought were part of my life<br/>
Is no longer brings me joy<br/>
Trying so hard to find the reason to wake up<br/>
At the same time, it's so hard to close my eyes<br/>

Day and night, there's no difference<br/>
Darkness and light, I just can't feel them<br/>
Like a sunflower in a rainy day<br/>
That can't find the sun who's hiding behind the cloud<br/>
And now I'm just facing the ground<br/>
Wondering what should I do<br/>
Will I ever be born again?<br/>
