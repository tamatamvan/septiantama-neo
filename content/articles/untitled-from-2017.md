It's 2.30 AM when I start writing this. Sleepless night as usual. Well, somehow I just get used to it and stop complaining about it. Also, that's not the thing I want to talk about right now.

Just a few moments ago, I just looked for something in my room, unloading a stack of papers and documents from the drawer. While I was searching for the things I'm looking for, a piece of paper with some terrible handwriting catch my attention. It was torn a little on one of its edges, folded irregularly, and there's some yellow to brown stains on it.

The terrible handwriting, it's mine, and it's a poem. When I flipped the paper, there's a logo of a famous hotel in Jakarta. "So, this is from 2017, the only time I went to that hotel was almost 3-years ago for that event, so it must be from around that time", that's what I thought.

Suddenly, I was trying to look back at the time, remembering my condition in that year. As I remember, 2017 was the time when my career starts rising, but it's also the time when my greatest teacher who gave all the good values in me, someone who really understands me, my beloved father left this world.

I have to be honest, it left a deep wound on me. When finally I can start to see the results of my previous dedication. Recognizing the things that I wasn't sure about the possibility before, became clear to me that it's possible. It's the thing that I wanted to prove to him, but when I just getting started, his time just come to an end.

I remember for sure that I was trying to move on that year. It was hard for me, to lose someone who often guides me. I was trying to live on my own, and I understood that I have to. I kept moving forward while carrying all the values that had been taught to me.

Oftentimes I feel lost. I wish I still have him by my side, so I can tell him how I was doing today, and maybe ask for some wisdom. I just miss him. I always do. Yes, up to this point, I haven't been able to move on. I know I never will. 

And I believe that's how I feel when I wrote this untitled poem from 2017. It's in Bahasa Indonesia but I'll write the translation below it. 

<hr/>

Here's the poem:

<p>
<i>Dalam sunyi malam</i><br/>
<i>Aku terdiam</i><br/>
<i>Merasakan rindu yang terpendam</i><br/>
<i>dan rasa kasih yang tenggelam</i><br/>
</p>

<p>
<i>Bila nanti semua tentang kita</i><br/>
<i>Hanya akan menjadi legenda</i><br/>
<i>Apa yang akan kudapat dari sana?</i><br/>
<i>Akankah ada hal yang selama ini kudamba,</i><br/>
<i>datang dan mengisi jiwa</i><br/>
<i>Menjadi bagian dari diri yang rapuh</i><br/>
<i>Melengkapi, dan menjadikannya utuh</i><br/>
</p>

<p>
<i>Hingga nanti ketika saat itu tiba</i><br/>
<i>Akankah diri ini kan tetap di sini?</i><br/>
<i>Ataukah panggilan telah tiba,</i><br/>
<i>tuk kembali, pada ruang lain dimensi?</i><br/>
<p>

<hr/>

English translation:

<p>
<i>In a quiet night</i><br/>
<i>I'm silent</i><br/>
<i>Feel the longing held in the heart</i><br/>
<i>and the drowned love</i><br/>
</p>

<p>
<i>If someday the story about us</i><br/>
<i>become a legend</i><br/>
<i>What will I get there?</i><br/>
<i>Will the things I've been longing for,</i><br/>
<i>come and fill this soul</i><br/>
<i>Become a part of this broken self</i><br/>
<i>Complete it, and make it whole</i><br/>
</p>

<p>
<i>And when the time comes,</i><br/>
<i>will I still be here?</i><br/>
<i>Or maybe the calling has arrived</i><br/>
<i>to go back, to the other space of another dimension</i><br/>
</p>

And that's it! The untitled poem I wrote from 2017. It's short, but it's interesting to me since I don't really remember the moment I wrote this. When I read it, I try to recall and understand my past self. The result is what I wrote above. The memories and feelings about my father. 

The interpretation of the poem may different from each person, and I'm okay with that. Also, it may not a really good poem, but writing something like this is my way to release my inner emotions. It's the things I do to put down some burden in my life, and I always love it.

Thanks for reading it until the very end!
I wish you a good life, see ya!
