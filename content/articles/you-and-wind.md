Forget to breathe <br/>
But I'm still alive <br/>
Something I feel <br/>
But I don't know why <br/>
Only you I see <br/>
Sing me a lullaby <br/>
Would you tell me <br/>
What's beyond that sky <br/>

As those stars keep blinking  <br/>
Do they calling me or mocking me? <br/>
Either way doesn't matter to me <br/>
As I'm in love with the wind <br/>
Whispering and fondling me softly <br/>
In the place where nobody knows <br/>
At the time when there's no life <br/>

But the wind never stay <br/>
Keeps moving to leave me behind <br/> 
Wiped my tears but didn't stop it <br/>
